# ICR-2023-Phylogenetics

## Background

This project provides a comparison of the effectivness of different summarizing statistics used to map the spread of disease, most notably the direction of infection(who infected whom).

##

##Running the code
You must first make sure that the 'simulated_trees' file is in the same directory as the sumstat_implement.py file
To run the code you must first activate ete3(example using conda):

"""
conda activate ete3
python3 sumstat_implement.py
"""
 The graphs produced by the program are automatically saved as png files under the newly created directory: sumstat_graphs
