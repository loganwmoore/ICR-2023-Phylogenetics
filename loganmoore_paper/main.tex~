\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

Phylogenetic trees can be used as a method of conveying important information regarding species and their common ancestors. They can also be an important tool in the world of virology as they can be analysed to find important information regarding disease transmission. One piece of information that can be found is the direction of disease transmission. This is found using a combination of summarizing statistics which analyse tree size, shape, and topology. The goal of this paper is to establish a comparison of each summarizing statistic and to acess if certain statistics more accuratly measure direction than others.

\section{Background}
\label{background}

Analysis of phylogenetic trees is an important area of investigation. Effective analysis could allow for key insight into the patterns and changes that take place in species and viruses. Summarizing statistics for the direction of disease transmission have also been explored. The summary statistics that will be analysed in this paper come from an article published by Ethan O Romero-Severson et al. In this paper, they described 9 summary statistics the first of which was the root label of the tree. This is found by examining each node and its children. To find the root label, two sisters are acessed as being either a lineage for host A or a lineage for host B. If both are in host A, then the parent node can also be labeled as A because the parent created two lineages both within A meaning that the parent themself must also be in A. The same rule applies if both sisters belong to B. If one is A and the other is B then the parent is labeled as unknown or ?. If one sister is A or B and the other is ? then the parent will be asigned A or B depending on the identity of the defined child. Using this pattern and working up the tree, eventually the children of the root will be assesed, thus determining the root label. The root label does not provide a difinitive donor identity but it is a way to gain a rough inferance.

The second summary statistic is the toplogical class. This is a method of assessing grouping patterns amongst nodes. The classes are assessed based on if the lineages are polyphyletic or monophyletic. Polyphyletic would mean that the lineages within the host appear on different branches of the tree, sperated by lineages from the other host. Monophyletic means that all of the lineages within that host are on the same branch of the tree, unseperated by lineages from other hosts. This means that, in this case where there are two hosts, the topological class is either PP where both hosts are polyphyletic, MP where one host is monophyletic and the other is polyphyletic, and MM where both are monophyletic. This allows for assessment of tree shape and distribution which gives insight to the patters of lineage transmission and thus helps determine direction.

The third summary statistic is the minimum number of transmissive lineages for each possible donor. This requires the consideration of the two scenerios where each host is the donor. From these scenarios, the minimum number of transmissive lineages is counted by observing branches which contain only the other host. The number of these diversions is the minimum number of transmissive lineages. This can help evaluate the likelyhood of each host being the donor as it would provide the amount of lineages that must have been transmitted if the host was the donor.

The fifth, sixth, and seventh statistics described were the average pairwise distances between tips with opposite labels, tips with A labels, and tips with B labels(A and B being the two hosts). This provides another measure for tree shape. This statistic can offer a comparison between distances which may lead to a coorilation to donor-recipient relations.

\section{Method}
\label{method}

The method used in this paper for the comparison and evaluation of the effectivness of each summary statistic was the use of a python program to apply each summary statistic to large sets of simulated trees. This would allow for a large data set of trees with known donors to be evaluated by each summary statistic and graphed in order to allow for easy comparison and evaluation of effectivness. This involved runing 23 sets of 50 trees, each set with its own parameters, through the program and plotting the collective data from each summary statistic to evaluate patterns.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

As seen in the data for summary statistic 1(Figure 1), overall the donor(D) appeared most often as the root label for almost all of the sets of trees. There are noteable exceptions in sets E, F, H, I, and J. In addition, this summary statistic alone would not provide a difinitive donor-recipient relationship, especially if only given a single tree as one would have to consider that the tree could be an exception. In the data for summary statistic 2(Figure 2), the most frequent topological class for every data set is PP. However, a notable pattern is that when the topological class is not PP, it is most likely to be MP with the recipient being monophyletic and the donor being polyphyletic. While this is not constant across all trees, it does show coorilation. The data for summary statistic 3(Figure 3) shows an overall trend that more often than not, the true donor will have fewer transmissive lineages than when the recipient is the donor. However, this is only a general trend and is not consistant across the different sets, or even in some cases, within the sets themselves.
